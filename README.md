![Bus display showing bus in 2 minutes](branding/ultrawide/2mins.png)

This displays upcoming buses in the West Midlands, using the most accuate API I could find. Initially written to be used in a smart TV browser, to become a 'bus departures' channel.

Many of the illustrations are taken from the amazing [unDraw](https://undraw.co/).

## 🚏 Show my own bus stop

Add `?stopId=YOUR_STOP_ID&serviceNumber=YOUR_SERVICE_NUMBER` to the URL

For example [`?stopId=43000008102&serviceNumber=12X`](https://adamjones.me/west-midlands-bus-display/?stopId=43000008102&serviceNumber=12X)

Apologies for the rather messy code - this was a short day project where the main aim was to make something pretty (and where all features were supported by a smart TV browser).
